FIT CTU - BIK-OSY (Operating Systems)

## Annotation
This course is the introduction into the theory of operating systems (OSs). We explain the history of OSs, architecture of OSs (with examples of solutions in unix-like OS and MS Windows), process/thread management (their implementation, life cycle, scheduling algorithms, priority schemes), interprocess communication and synchronization using synchronization primitives, algorithms solving classical interprocess communication problems (such as producer-consumer, readers-writers, sleeping barbers), deadlock problem and its solutions, memory management (virtual memory, paging, segmentation, swaping, page replacement algorithms), storages, and file systems and their classical (e.g., FAT, UFS, NTFS) or modern (e.g., using B+-trees) implementations.

It assumes a good knowledge of programming in C/C++.
